## gpio_config_t io_conf;
This is a structure (struct) defined inside ESP-IDF.

it like a form where we should fill in the information and give it to the ESP32:

Which pin?
Input or output?
Pull-up or pull-down?
Interrupt or not?

for the selecting the GPIO

1 in binary (64-bit): 0000...0001 (bit 0 is set) ULL is a Unsigned Long Long (64-bit number)
Shift left by 23:     0000...0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 (bit 23 is set)

So, our GPIO is fixed now we dont need any thing from this structure so we keep them in DISABLE state.



gpio_config(&io_conf);
this sends the configuration to hardware.
